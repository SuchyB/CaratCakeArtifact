The files in this directory are used to create the serial version
of CVL.  Installation should be relatively simple:  just

make -f Makefile.dist cvl

Possible problems: 
1. syntax errors at compile time: your compiler might define _STDC_ 
   but not really be an ANSI C compiler.  You'll have to hunt these
   down.
2. the rank functions (rk*_l**) aren't working: check that the #defines
   are correct for your machine, in particular whether FP_LITTLE_ENDIAN
   was correctly defined.

If you encounter any problems, please send email to sipelstein@cs.cmu.edu
Submitted fixes will be incorporated quickly; fixes that I need to figure
out will take a little longer.
