These files comprise the source code for the VCODE interpreter.  
VCODE is a stack-based intermediate code with segmented vectors
as the primary data-type.  The documentation for VCODE should be
found in the doc directory of this release.

In most cases, you should just be able to type "make" in the 
top-level nesl distribution directory.  If this fails, do the following:
1. Examine the file config.h.  Make any requires changes.
2. Read the Makefile and make any needed changes to the compiler
and default flags.
